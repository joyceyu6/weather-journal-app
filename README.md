# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Course Topics Covered 
This project covered below major topics from *Web APIs and Asynchronous Applications* course from Udacity
* Setup a Node environment with Express and the necessary project dependencies
* Setup a server with GET and POST routes
* Create developer credentials for a Web API
* Use the Fetch API with my credentials and user input to get dynamic data into my app routes
* Access a GET route on the server side, from a function called on the client side
* Chain Promises together
* Access HTML elements with JavaScript and set their properties dynamically

## Key Prerequisites
